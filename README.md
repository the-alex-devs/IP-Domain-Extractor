# IP-Domain-Extractor
A GUI-based Python script that extracts IPs and domain names from a text document in an easy format to copy and paste into firewalls or other devices for blocklists.

# How To Use
Simply run CTO_Extractor.pyw. Click Open File, then select a text document that contains IPs and/or domain names that you need extracted. It will then output a line-by-line list that can be pasted into Palo Alto firewalls or other network devices to easily add into blocklists or anything else you may need.
